Remember, that tkinter is an open-source framework, so even if you have some exotic error or question, you can always look up the answer on the internet. Do not be afraid to ask questions, or question practices given in these notebooks. There is no \"true way\" of coding in python, as even most experienced developers have arguments about codestyles and implementations still to this day. Best thing you can do is read code and write your own. Do not forget that you can even look up the tkinter module code on your computer (however, due to the scale of tkinter, the code is rather complex for beginners)"
